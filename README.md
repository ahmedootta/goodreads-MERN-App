# Goodreads - App

## Overview

Goodreads - App is a comprehensive web application designed to provide a rich and interactive experience for book lovers, mirroring the core functionalities of the well-known Goodreads platform. This application serves as a central hub for managing a vast database of books, authors, and categories, offering both administrators and users a range of features tailored to their specific needs.

## Features

### Admin Panel

The admin panel is the backbone of the Goodreads - App, providing powerful tools for managing the entire ecosystem of books, authors, and categories.

- **Book Management**: Admins have full control over the book database. They can add new books, update existing entries, or remove books from the database as needed. This ensures that the collection remains current and relevant.

- **Category & Author Management**: Categories and authors are essential to the structure of the book database. Admins can create and manage categories, allowing books to be organized in a meaningful way. Additionally, admins can add and associate authors with their respective books, ensuring that each book is correctly attributed and easily searchable.

- **Collections**: Books can be grouped into collections, making it easier for admins to organize and manage the database. Collections could represent genres, series, or any other logical grouping that enhances the browsing experience.

- **Admin Authorization**: Security and access control are paramount. The app features a robust login system for administrators, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the admin panel. Once logged in, admins gain full control over the database, with the ability to make changes that affect all users.

### User System

Goodreads - App also focuses on providing a personalized experience for users, allowing them to interact with the book database in ways that reflect their reading habits and preferences.

- **User Authentication**: The app includes a secure and straightforward authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in. This system ensures that each user has a personalized experience, with access to their own reading lists and reviews.

- **Reading Lists**: One of the standout features is the ability for users to curate their own reading lists. Users can add books to their lists and categorize them based on their reading status:
  - **Read**: Books that the user has finished.
  - **Currently Reading**: Books that the user is actively reading.
  - **Want to Read**: Books that the user intends to read in the future.

  This feature helps users track their reading progress and organize their literary interests.

- **Book Reviews**: Goodreads - App encourages users to engage with the community by leaving reviews for books they have read. Reviews can include ratings and written feedback, providing valuable insights for other users and contributing to the overall richness of the community experience.

- **Book Filtering**: Users can filter books based on specific categories or authors. This feature allows users to easily find books that match their specific interests, whether they are looking for works by a particular author or exploring a specific genre. By offering a refined search experience, the app ensures that users can quickly and effectively discover books that suit their preferences.

## Project Goals
